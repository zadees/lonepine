            After retiring from Bell South Telephone Co., Elaine and I started looking for new hobbies. I had spent most of my spare time during my working career, as a member and/or officer of various civic organizations, achieving the ultimate office of Potentate of the Zamora Shrine Temple. I also spent a lot of time hunting and fishing. Saying all of this to say, I soon realized I had to do something to fill my time. We used craft fairs and art shows as a form of entertainment the first few years. Elaine was into painting a little and kept saying she needed something to paint. I think she was thinking about toll paint, which was popular at that time.

            Someone gave us a nice Santa Clause Christmas of 1992 and a bold statement was made that I could make one just like it. Elaine had already been collecting Santa's for a few years, so the race was on to make her a handmade one. Several Santa's later, many books read, and of course, many tools purchased, I was in the near full time business of making wooden carving, mostly Santas.

            In 1999, I decide that I needed a big shot in the pants to further my carving skills. I had attended many small 3 day carving seminars around the USA, but things weren't progressing as far or fast as I wanted. After much research and talking, I convinced Elaine that we need to go to the World Famous Geisler-Moroder Austrian Wood Carving School located in Elbigenalp, Austria for extended studies. We saved our money and booked a four week vacation / course in wood sculpturing and painting for the month of September that year.

            We have never looked back on that decision. While attending the school, they hired me to be part of their staff. My position is North American Representative responsible for booking American wood carvers to attend the school. The school can be contacted at Geisler-Moroder@aon.at or visit us on the web at www.woodcarvingschool.com . Having the position of Representative has afforded me the opportunity to attend the school each year for the past ten years. While traveling in Europe each year, we visit numerous churches, museums, and witness the development of many outstanding sculptors. Each visit inspires me to want to come home and create a new piece.

            In addition to working with the school, I have taught night classes at my local civic center to beginner students. Three of these students have gone on to be President of the Tannehill Wood Carvers Club. I was President of the club in 1998 and am now holding membership in three clubs. I have been a member of the National Wood Carvers Association since 1993. I have judged shows in the South East and have won several Blue Ribbons at shows as well.
